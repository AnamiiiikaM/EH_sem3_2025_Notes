Ncat Chat Terminal Project Report – Assignment 1
Name: Anamika Manoj  Reg. No: 2463006  Course: Honors Cybersecurity

🔧 Methodology
To simulate a basic terminal-based chat system between two computers, I used ncat, a tool from the Nmap suite that facilitates raw TCP and UDP connections. The task was performed in a Kali Linux environment. Two shell scripts were created:
•	One to act as a listener (Terminal A)
•	One to act as a sender (Terminal B)
Communication was done over TCP using port 5000.

⚙️ Installation & Setup
Before starting, ensure ncat is installed. It usually comes pre-installed with Kali Linux, but if not, install it using:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ncat
ncat --version
________________________________________
💻 Code 
Open terminal and type:
nano listener.sh
nano sender.sh
listener.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting listener on port 5000..."
ncat -lvp 5000
sender.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Connecting to chat..."
ncat 127.0.0.1 5000
Make Scripts Executable
chmod +x listener.sh sender.sh
________________________________________
🧪 Execution Steps
1.	Open Terminal A and run ./listener.sh
2.	Open Terminal B and run ./sender.sh
3.	Type messages in either terminal to simulate chat

🔍 Findings
•	Communication: Two-way text messages in real-time
•	Protocol Used: TCP via port 5000
•	Localhost Setup: 127.0.0.1 (loopback IP), can switch to LAN IP
•	Setup Time: Less than 5 minutes
•	Learning Outcome: Demonstrates ports and sockets usage in real-world scenarios
________________________________________
🔐 Security Insight
•	Port Exposure: Listener opens TCP port 5000, which can be targeted
•	Risk: If the terminal is left unattended, it can be hijacked or misused
•	Relevance in Cybersecurity: Common method in red teaming, used to open backdoors or initiate reverse shells

📘 Conclusion
This assignment provided a hands-on understanding of TCP-based communication using ncat. With only 10 lines of shell scripting and two terminal sessions, I simulated a working chat system that demonstrates key cybersecurity and networking concepts. This experiment builds foundational knowledge useful in penetration testing, network diagnostics, and defensive monitoring.
